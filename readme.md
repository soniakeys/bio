Bio
===

Bioinformatics alorithms implemented in Go.

Code here is exploratory.  It is the work of one bioinformatics enthusiast,
one with no background in related industry or academics.

Go source files contain the standard go doc format documentation for most
exported functions.  In addition there is an overview in the Github repository
wiki at https://github.com/soniakeys/bio/wiki.
